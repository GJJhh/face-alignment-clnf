# clnf

This project is a small update of https://github.com/FaceAR/OpenFaceIOS this project.

Here opencv camera preview rendering is replaced with ios and mac API.

Next I want to replace the opencv face detection with ios and mac API.

My main purpose is to check the actual frame rate for CLNF Frame Rate and if there is any workaround to improve the frame rate of this CLNF implementation.
